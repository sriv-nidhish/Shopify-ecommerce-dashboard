# Shopify-ecommerce-dashboard

> This project focuses on **transforming a dummy Shopify transaction log into an executive-ready narrative** that explains what occurred, why it matters, and which strategic initiatives can follow. Four sequential “chapters” guide the reader from a high-level business overview to SKU-level product decisions, interweaving SQL queries, CSV outputs, and Tableau dashboards into one continuous storyline.

### Chapter 1 – Business Overview

#### Rationale
Month-over-month figures for orders, revenue, and **Average Order Value (AOV)** provide the clearest snapshot of commercial health, while their growth rates indicate whether campaigns, seasonality, or site changes are delivering meaningful returns.
